# Just-JS

My JS refresher by doing simple things to understand random js stuffs

mostly consists of excercises from the tutorials i follow

almost all the lodash-xx function i implemented are HOF, except for defaults and get , because that doesn't take function as arguments (i.e no function is being passed to it unlike other lodash implementation which had either a predicate or iteratee function being passed to it as a param) nor does it return an function.

Still a few more challenges to go

You can't return/break out of forEach loop, since the callback function is getting applied to all the elelments of an array.
